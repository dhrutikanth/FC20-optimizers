1: You can report any place that you feel must be cleaned up.
2: You can raise funds to restore parks, gardens, and other areas rich in biodiversities.
3: You can volunteer to help other NGOs in completing their task sooner.
Once you sign-up on our platform, you will have the facilities to report any area near you that you feel must be tidied.
Once you report the area, we will connect with the nearest NGO that can undertake the task.
You can also volunteer to help the NGOs that are willing to help restore cleanliness in your area.
